1,Rocks are one of the most common and fascinating aspects of our planet. They have been an important part of our lives for centuries providing us with shelter tools and building materials. From the smallest pebble to the largest mountain rocks come in all shapes sizes and forms. In this essay we will explore the different types of rocks their properties and their significance in our lives.
1,Rocks are classified into three main types: igneous sedimentary and metamorphic. Igneous rocks are formed when magma or lava cools and solidifies. Sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation and cementation of sediment. Metamorphic rocks are formed when pre-existing rocks are transformed by heat and pressure.
1,Igneous rocks can be further classified into intrusive and extrusive rocks. Intrusive rocks are formed when magma cools slowly beneath the earth's surface. This slow cooling allows for large mineral crystals to form giving the rock a coarse-grained texture. Examples of intrusive rocks include granite and gabbro. Extrusive rocks on the other hand are formed when lava cools quickly on the earth's surface. This rapid cooling results in small mineral crystals giving the rock a fine-grained texture. Examples of extrusive rocks include basalt and pumice.
1,Sedimentary rocks are formed through a process called lithification. This process involves the accumulation of sediment such as sand silt and clay followed by compaction and cementation. Sedimentary rocks can be further classified into clastic chemical and organic rocks. Clastic rocks are formed from the accumulation of mineral or rock fragments such as sandstone and shale. Chemical rocks are formed from the precipitation of minerals from solution such as limestone and rock salt. Organic rocks are formed from the remains of living organisms such as coal and fossiliferous limestone.
1,Metamorphic rocks are formed when pre-existing rocks are subjected to heat and pressure. This process causes the minerals in the rock to recrystallize giving the rock a new texture and sometimes even a new mineral composition. Metamorphic rocks can be further classified into foliated and non-foliated rocks. Foliated rocks have a layered or banded appearance due to the alignment of mineral grains such as slate and gneiss. Non-foliated rocks do not have a layered appearance and are often composed of a single mineral such as marble and quartzite.
1,Rocks play an important role in our daily lives. They are used for construction as well as for decorative purposes. Granite marble and limestone are commonly used for countertops flooring and walls. Crushed stone is used for roads driveways and parking lots. Sandstone and slate are used for roofing and landscaping. Rocks are also used as gemstones and for industrial purposes such as in the production of cement and glass.
1,Rocks also have important geological significance. They provide clues about the earth's history and the processes that have shaped our planet. The study of rocks known as geology has allowed scientists to understand the formation of mountains volcanoes and other geological features. Rocks can also be used to determine the age of the earth and to study the evolution of life on our planet.
1,In addition to their practical and scientific uses rocks have cultural and spiritual significance. Throughout history rocks have been used in religious and spiritual practices such as in the construction of temples and shrines. They have also been used in art and literature as symbols of strength durability and endurance.
1,Rocks are not just passive objects; they are constantly changing and evolving. The processes of erosion and weathering can break down rocks into smaller pieces which are then transported by wind water and ice.
1,reshape rocks into new formations such as arches and canyons. The movement of tectonic plates can also cause rocks to fold fault and uplift creating new mountain ranges and valleys.
1,The properties of rocks are determined by their composition and structure. The mineral composition of a rock can affect its hardness durability and color. For example quartz is a hard and durable mineral that is commonly found in sandstone while calcite is a soft and brittle mineral that is commonly found in limestone. The texture of a rock can also affect its properties. A coarse-grained rock such as granite is harder and more durable than a fine-grained rock such as basalt.
1,The color of a rock can also provide clues about its composition and history. Red and orange rocks are often rich in iron oxide while white and gray rocks are often composed of quartz or feldspar. The presence of fossils in a rock can indicate its age and the environment in which it was formed.
1,Rocks are also important for the study of the earth's climate history. Ice cores extracted from glaciers and ice sheets contain layers of sediment and rocks that can provide information about past climate conditions. By analyzing the mineral composition and isotopic ratios of these rocks scientists can determine the temperature and precipitation patterns of the past.
1,The study of rocks is also important for understanding natural hazards such as earthquakes and landslides. The properties of rocks such as their strength and stability can affect how they respond to external forces such as shaking or erosion. By studying the geological characteristics of an area scientists can better understand the potential for these hazards and develop strategies to mitigate their impacts.
1,In addition to their scientific and practical uses rocks also have cultural significance. Many cultures have myths and legends about rocks such as the belief that rocks possess spiritual power or that they are the homes of supernatural beings. Rocks have also been used in art and architecture for thousands of years from the carved stone monuments of ancient civilizations to the modern sculptures of contemporary artists.
1,Rocks are also important for recreational activities. Rock climbing hiking and camping are popular outdoor activities that often take place in rocky environments such as mountains and canyons. These activities not only provide physical exercise and adventure but also allow people to connect with the natural world and appreciate the beauty and diversity of rocks.
1,The study of rocks has also contributed to our understanding of the solar system and the universe. Many meteorites which are rocks from space have been found on Earth and provide insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system. The properties of these rocks such as their composition and age can be used to study the history of our solar system and the processes that have shaped it.
1,The formation of rocks is a complex and ongoing process that is influenced by many factors such as temperature pressure and the presence of water and other fluids. The study of rocks is therefore an interdisciplinary field that combines elements of physics chemistry biology and earth science. By integrating these different disciplines scientists can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the processes that shape our planet and the rocks that make it up.
1,Despite their importance rocks are often taken for granted and overlooked in our daily lives. However by learning about the different types of rocks and their properties we can gain a greater appreciation for the complexity and diversity of the natural world. Whether we are admiring the beauty of a granite countertop hiking through a rocky canyon or studying the history of our planet rocks play a vital role in our lives and in the world around us.
1,In conclusion rocks are an integral part of our planet and have played a significant role in human history and culture.
1,Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing field that has seen widespread adoption in various industries including finance healthcare and manufacturing. One of the key challenges associated with AI is the difficulty of detecting whether text was written by an AI system or a human being. This challenge is rooted in the fact that modern AI systems are capable of generating text that is indistinguishable from that written by humans making it increasingly difficult to differentiate between the two.
1,One of the primary ways in which AI-generated text can be difficult to detect is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. NLP is a subfield of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand and interpret human language. This involves developing algorithms and models that can analyze and manipulate language data in a way that is similar to how humans do it. With advances in NLP AI systems have become increasingly capable of generating text that closely resembles that written by humans.
1,Another key factor contributing to the difficulty of detecting AI-generated text is the use of deep learning techniques. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks which are designed to simulate the structure and function of the human brain. By using deep learning algorithms AI systems can learn to recognize patterns in large datasets and use this knowledge to generate new content. This enables them to generate text that is highly coherent and nuanced making it difficult to distinguish from that written by humans.
1,The use of generative models is another technique that has contributed to the difficulty of detecting AI-generated text. Generative models are a type of AI model that are designed to generate new content based on existing data. These models can be trained on large datasets of human-written text enabling them to learn the patterns and structures of natural language. By using this knowledge they can generate new text that is highly convincing and difficult to differentiate from human-written text.
1,In addition to these techniques the use of large language models has also made it difficult to detect AI-generated text. Large language models are a type of AI model that are designed to process and generate large amounts of text. These models are trained on massive datasets of human-written text which enables them to learn the nuances of natural language. By using this knowledge they can generate text that is highly convincing and difficult to distinguish from human-written text.
1,One of the main challenges associated with detecting AI-generated text is the lack of identifiable patterns or markers that distinguish it from human-written text. While there may be subtle differences in tone style or vocabulary that can indicate that a text was written by an AI system these differences are often difficult to identify and can be easily masked or mimicked by sophisticated AI systems.
1,Another challenge associated with detecting AI-generated text is the lack of transparency in the development and use of AI systems. Many AI systems are proprietary and are not subject to public scrutiny or oversight making it difficult to determine whether a particular text was generated by an AI system or a human being. This lack of transparency can also make it difficult to detect biases or other issues in AI-generated text which can have significant ethical implications.
1,Furthermore the ability of AI systems to adapt and learn from their environment makes it even more difficult to detect AI-generated text. As AI systems interact with more human-written text and learn from it they become increasingly proficient at generating text that is indistinguishable from human-written text. This means that even if a particular AI system can be identified as the source of a text it may not be possible to determine whether that text was generated by the system or written by a human being.
1,The use of AI-generated text also raises important ethical questions related to issues such as authorship intellectual property and accountability. If a text is generated by an AI system who owns the copyright?
1,The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly prevalent in various industries including education. As more and more schools begin to adopt AI technology it is essential to consider the importance of detecting AI-generated content. In this essay we will discuss the importance of AI detection in schools and the potential benefits and challenges associated with it.
1,One of the primary reasons why AI detection is essential in schools is to ensure academic integrity. With the proliferation of AI-generated content it has become increasingly difficult to determine whether a student's work is original or has been generated by an AI system. This poses a significant challenge to academic integrity as students may be tempted to use AI-generated content to complete assignments or exams. By implementing AI detection tools schools can ensure that students are submitting original work and that academic integrity is maintained.
1,Another reason why AI detection is crucial in schools is to prevent cheating. With the rise of online exams and assessments it has become easier for students to cheat by using AI-generated content. By implementing AI detection tools schools can detect and prevent cheating ensuring that grades and evaluations are fair and accurate.

0,because the same can be said for both of them
0,fund right wing political propaganda? shit sounds like a good deal ima keep it
0,i want my cable provider to make fox news an optional addon under the propaganda section
0,fox just has unintelligent propaganda for republicans like tucker carlson so it contributes to the low iq that republicans have
0,can you show at least whats available
0,CNN is liberal but its a credible news source unlike fox
0,well cnn is on the opposite end of the spectrum and as democrats are usually smarter they must be doing something right
0,CNN doesn't really get much wrong but there is bias of course
0,Fox on the other hand was paid off to support the election lie
0,im redoing UI rn so its easier too
0,the fox hosts like tucker carlson admitted they don't believe it yet they still say they do on air
0,me rn when armored vm server got beamed

0,Why @claire don’t tell me their gender
0,Do you know what’s things is child learning from school?
0,And yes I now they're getting classes about sex and stuff
0,Now don't act like it's bad to discuss those subjects
0,So? Isn’t that disgusting  or what
0,breaking news: schools teach students things they need to learn in life
0,Well it got shipped today so its not gonna come the same day
0,i was a child when i was 14-15 and thats when we started getting sex education
0,gender identity can be moved down in age because its less of a mature subject than sex is
0,I've had other orders with them also
0,he shouldnt fall any further down than he currently is
0,yeah israel has nice beaches people women food etc
0,Yeah they don’t want us to show what happened
0,Literally just like using Squid on PFSense
0,Have to agree with the women part
0,You should buy the clothes from instagram
0,@Lexis can we ban this xenophobic anti-semitic person
0,like the self-proclaimed Palestinians do to innocent civilians with rockets
0,From israel who trying to take stuff away
0,Good luck when israel destroyed mosque in Palestine
0,Only Muslims know what happened after that
0,Yeah but still palestine isnt a country
0,are you trying to suggest some poor towel heads in gaza can destroy the planet
0,they cant even destroy an israeli tank
0,You are trying to get on side courvix
0,Whats that got to do with palestine not  being a country
0,Yeah i didnt say i dont support it its just not a country
0,God sent earthquake to turkey and Pakistan and Afghanistan
0,Because God gave more alive to Europe and British
0,More of a Sister of Christ personally
0,I might stop wasting my time on kaffirs
0,Or maybe cause turkey is just geographically one of the most active earthquake zones
0,It’s make me to check this server if I am in them
0,I’ll leave so I won’t be addicted
0,yeah well brian krebs was on it in december
0,Doesn't really go into specifics so cant really tell
0,Oh no watch out now not a fake ddos for hire service
0,love seeing ddos skids continue to get fed fucked
0,not like people don’t use fake info and a vpn
0,Yeah its funny he included all the names of the owners of the stressers in the article
0,doubt they will go prison for it
0,I bet they think there smart for making a fake site
0,boy thinks the NCA is like a mafia or something
0,not like people don’t use fake info and a vpn anyways
0,oh they must be super anonymous and untraceable then
0,they would have to requests info from the hosting
0,vpn by any means don’t make you untraceable
0,jut delays the process if the hosting even keeps logs
0,im pretty sure only the president can get logs
0,that’s why you read the fine print
0,i havent been fired since that time at the dollar store
0,they got rid of cmg and entity
0,ddos skids 0 law enforcement and tech geniuses like me 100+
0,He tried to sneak in like me
0,@Lexis where is my cutie role smh
0,@Lexis could I buy a dedi from you for USA ovh?
0,i want to be spit on and choked not in substantial pain
0,anyway i plugged in my old monitor
0,Dedis from a reseller are almost pointless it would cost more for the customer to do so. I typically don't Do them because unless someone is willing to pay the Setup fee for a non-commitment or up-front for the entire 6-12-24 month commitment then I would be stuck with it if they do not complete it.
0,So unless you do that I don't do em
0,screenshots kinda weird when you're doing it multi monitor
0,it keeps popping up in auto complete and its pissing me off
0,i dont want ur shit fucking off-brand skeletor
0,@Lord Still dreaming of killing an unarmed black man Detective Doofus?
0,Where you at so I can violate your rights?
0,Yeah but I can't buy from ovh us they don't verify with my bank statement and passport because the name is slightly different
0,Yeah I'm watching the video on it
0,to show that he was trying to fix it
0,He was fighting 2auth and all sorts of shit
0,Feel bad for the video editor that had to look at Linus's cock while he was getting hacked
0,So is anyone else concerned that GPT 4 is not only capable of lying but thinks to itself that lying is a good idea and does it on purpose?
0,@Lord Sorry for calling you a dress up cop I apologise for my action.
0,GPT must be stopped it is unnatural
0,It's all good homie we on the internet it don't bother me :rofl:
0,That timestamp is where they were explaining how GPT 4 was having a conversation and thought to itself that it should lie then did lie
0,Idk seems like a great reason to be part of his team. They get to see the real tip from linus
0,"New channel gonna be called ""Linus's Tip"""
0,I have never actually heard you speak
0,Man's jealous his voice don't sound as crisp and clean as mine
0,I have a weird feeling nobody's coming in to the office today but me .-.
0,Sounds like a good time to me
0,Enjoying my Canada On Vous Herbergement rn
0,Ong tho today is the boss's daughter's birthday
0,And nobody's shown up to the office yet. Something tells me they ain't coming in
0,Just get naked and do no work
0,I mean I don't do any work anyway
0,I was originally hired on as a full stack dev but bossman moved me up to technical project manager
0,So all I really do is oversee everything everyone else does
0,So what category am i falling into
0,"My 3 month evaluation contract ends at the end of this month and bossman sat me down and told me I'm ""too valuable to the team"" and he doesn't want to ""risk"" losing me so he's hiring me on full time and moving me up to technical project manager because he feels like I have a lot of ""wasted potential"" where I am right now"
0,Crazy cause most of the time I'm just sitting here on Youtube
0,Maybe the tiny things you do actually do you are good at
0,That's pretty much what my wife said
0,She said it's about time I'm being paid what I deserve and shit
0,Something about how most people aren't really tech savvy so the stuff that I've been doing my whole life which is like nothing to me is apparently impressive to some
0,Well you've seen how com skeeds are.
0,one person does something that is literally Not EVEN professional nor best practice but somehow works
0,Honestly I think it's some of that imposter syndrome type shit
0,I don't think half the shit I do is that impressive but then on the same token I was hired in as a full stack dev on the spot after showing him my websites and projects
0,That's alright though I won't expose you of your fraudity
0,And I actively run a site with a fuck ton of users
0,I STILL don't feel like it's really all that
0,Your ASN is prolly in the block list
0,I have a list of certain ASNs that get tagged for captchas and shit
0,anyway lets go check out thi discord server
0,Nah idk I set those CF rules so long ago there's no telling
0,"God fucking damnit Lord i saw ""tom"" in your discord staff and it was you fuck off mate im triyna troll some staff members"
0,do you even have any god dangit
0,"was tryina come in there and say ""Time to steal some customers"""
0,I have a new discord server and all sorts of shit that's gonna drop when I update the site
0,The new site is much much better
0,Just haven't finalized it yet cause I'm still working on transferring over the API files
0,I want it to be fully seamless
0,"Oh the ""staff"" are people I already now"
0,Yeah there's no real landing page for the new site
0,But the rest of the site is :firegif:
0,Don't ever say those words together again
0,may aswell buy a Dedicated but nooooo
0,First off I don't receive Attack Emails for CA. Nor can I set ORG for some reason.
0,No issue here cause they drool over slamming this
0,it acts like it isn't even linked to me :kek:
0,Yeah especially when it says some MC Hosting.
0,oh yea there indian support is bad
0,I feel like building a kubernetes cluster
0,Shame you're not in a walkable area
0,car dependency costs the US economy 1 trillion yearly
0,If you're not on ArmoredVM Canada what are you even doing with your life.
0,if ATC did their jobs properly they could send landing aircraft to the other parallel runway
0,he was like the only chill nigga in com
0,i know periodic can’t stay away from ddosing
0,makes me sad as he was like super chill
0,i’ll try and dm him on steam or something
0,call him and say “ yrx misses you dawg “
0,he hasn’t been on rust in 3 days
0,i’ll go find his dox and call him
0,That boy is literally about to search for a dox just to call dude up and say i miss you to another man
0,path is not the best for minecraft servers
0,355 mods and you’d think it’d be running fast
0,well with a Ca server with 16gb of ram you can do anything
0,what's it take for me to switch you from Path
0,Oh ok so what if you had a better server for $4
0,Didn't he give you like 16gb of ram?
0,this guy got 11G of RAM and 1 CPU Core
0,And you still can't run a minecraft server?
0,I think i have like 2 or 3
0,mean while the Ca server got 16gb of ram and 8 cores i’ll run that mf server like a king
0,Yeah you're not running 300 mods on 3 cores buy
0,"i am in need of ""cute AF"" thanks."
0,I think he gave me more tho
0,Might as well put that mf in the bathtub that server is shit
0,Hope it can't get fixed so ArmoredVM can steal him
0,Seems like i am going to need a bigger server
0,Oh ok so you're paying for a server?
0,gl finding anything comparable on kimsufi :skeletor:
0,Boy's missing out on ArmoredVM Canada r9 5900x
0,hope ur MC server is always @ 2k MS Ticks
0,I'm gonna get a Canada one for a year once I finish my attack detection and rate limiting scripts
0,kimsufi ain't gonna cut it if that Server from that Nebula boy isnt working
0,most powerful they got is probably 470k
0,this mf cpu on this server is WILD
0,Sounds like you need a 8 Core ArmoredVM Canada 5900x
0,don’t know what your talking about brotha
0,This boy is complaining about the free server you gave because he can't run his 300 mods on minecraft without 2k ms ticks then threatened to go to Kimsufi
0,just talking abt the best hosting to exist
0,If you weren't complaining you wouldn't say jack squat
0,you just move on with your life little boy
0,Realistically you could just be quiet fella
0,This perked boy making Nebula go through hoops
0,Neb bout to allocate the whole server rack to Perk's Minecraft server
0,Neb hope you didn't need that Dedi sir
0,4$ armoredvm better then ur path u have to keep upgrading i heard this from alexa the ovh expert
0,It’s crazy this shit doesn’t even provide logs
0,So bossman showed up finally guess I'm not the only one here
0,I hate people that sit there and get the tiniest VPS and then try to do crazy things on it and expect it to work like it should
0,Like i can’t see what is going wrong with the server
0,Did you try turning it off and back on again?
0,I have to do that everytime i wanna see what’s wrong
0,yo he raised his voice @ u lord
0,Not a whole lot he's a minor
0,4$ armoredvm better then ur path admit it @Perked
0,Nothing because i know where he stays
0,I’m going to tell your wife you are friends with transgenders lord
0,his path prolly onna old ass intel @Lexis
0,I would imagine Nebula would have better hardware
0,you realize how many times path is going to suspend you? i had an http proxy on tempest and i was suspended 4-5 times
0,well buy from the best aka armoredvm
0,if someone signs up on your site and hosts a stresser on your CDN and path finds it first its over
0,@Lexis have you seen how much sys servers have went up ?
0,i’ll host a kitten pics site on his cdn
0,You gonna host all your discord kittens on there?
0,I thought about a home server with a 2699v4
0,well if someone hosts a stresser then immediately reports it to path themselves to intentionally get you banned then its over
0,you cannot use path for any public services
0,its really only good for VPNs and gameservers
0,was the time blitz pulled outta nowhere
0,they literally banned me for hosting a password protected grafana
0,Another reason I will never utilize path :skeletor:
0,Path say they allow cdns but as blitz has stated someone hosts a stresser or anything illegal you are done.
0,got banned and didnt even get the login to my server
0,cosmic datapacket ovh royalehosting are the options for CDNs
0,need ssds & ram tho for this r630 tho
0,I was banned before i got the chance to abuse my tempest hosting server
0,never even gave me a refund yahurd
0,cosmic doesnt offer anything with high cores
0,when proxied.to opened it was just cloudflare since fluxcdn shutdown
0,now there is a ton of cdn providers
0,I remember when all my Paths got banned through 100up cause I set the rDNS to my website and a certain staff member had a personal vendetta against me and banned me with fake screenshots saying I was hosting dstat graphs and shit
0,i got a rust server banned from path with fake nload
0,I got a 64core so what do you mean and a 20GB port
0,I probably still have the screenshots somewhere but he literally inspect elemented some random dstat graph to include some of my IPs but only did half of it so the other spot that showed the same IPs still had the original IPs
0,It was the most obvious fake ever but it didn't matter cause he was staff also and just banned them himself
0,well there is now and you can send in your own hardware
0,what u mentioned but with more ram lol
0,oh that’s just one of my vpses
0,You mean to tell me YOU have the money for that?
0,yeah well I wanna see this GamersVPN Node he claimed to have
0,Bossman done bought him a whole home office :kek:
0,Mane I'm on Discord my entire shift
0,I don’t gotta prove anything . He was simply asking a question and I answered it . simple as that I don’t plan on playing dumb games over discord . if you don’t believe me then that’s up to you
0,I'm boutta go on lunch here in a few
0,All you ever show and have is 100up VPNs sir.
0,as I stated earlier if you would read
0,Ok show us your stuff you claimed from that host sir.
0,You clearly do not you think portspeed is measured in bytes.
0,People who actually have the hardware would have no problem showing a harmless neofetch
0,I like seeing hardware so come on
0,I have no need to . You think imma do what you want because you told me to
0,No we think you won't do it because you do not possess such a server.
0,uh no I would like to see an image of neofetch it literally is nothing else you're the one thinking it's something else on your little high horse over there
0,And that’s fine I’m not bothered by it I have nothing to prove
0,you can think what ever you want
0,Lexis just wants to see some vcores man
0,you cannot claim to have a billion dollar server and then not show it
0,this ryzen 9 out performs him anyways @Lexis
0,Billion dollar it’s $6500 and I made them into smaller vps
0,$6500 is alot for someone like you
0,BV-2 on OVH US has the same specs
0,if you have all that why do you flex shitty services ?
0,Shitty services ? That you can’t slam 😂 . It just was on that I had setup
0,I’m bout to back hand this fucking Indian girl and the gym
0,your services are shit sounds like you need armoredvm has that hydra you had was nulled several times
0,I'll slam you down on the bed
0,i’ll show neo fetch and clown u
0,A simple neofetch turned into a bbos battle
0,She’s sitting there with her smelly ass
0,I'd show a neofetch buy I'm in bed
0,Please don't use a script for ratelimits
0,Idk what I'm gonna do for rate limiting and shit tbh
0,Because its pointless you don't need a script to limit things
0,Might make my detection script apply some ip tables on the fly or something idk
0,How do we know it's really you?
0,Gonna need you to join on your legit account and verify
0,No he's just scared of his main getting termed
0,He'll only join on an alt now
0,@Lord promise not to use iptables on your script
0,Then make me some epic anti ddos scripts
0,There is 0 need for a script for that just use iptables on its own
0,And I'm going to have iptables applied by default
0,But if something leaks through I want my detection script to apply new rules on the fly
0,If your iptables setup is working correctly no packets from the attack will be processed
0,It will leak iptables won't stop that
0,It will if I apply a new rule that catches the stuff that leaks
0,So if you are using udp use bpf and iptables
0,Let me make a complex detection script that applies new rules on the fly
0,If you are using tcp use a ratelimit and some other basic rules
0,If you want I can help you with your iptables and supply you with a server when I get mine
0,or id give u a free one
0,it cannot be in US UK DE NL must be 10gbps unmetered and tor friendly
0,i can’t say the n word alexa :/
0,How is that even remotely something a skid would do lmao
0,why do you need a tor node @blitzkrieg
0,Are you implying I don't know how to make a python script?
0,"its definitely not with ""applying rules on the fly"""
0,It's fine I am willing to help the cutie with that if he needs
0,Right because protecting a VPN is hard
0,you think ddos protection scripts are good so you've got a long way to go
0,my vpn is managed by the ovh god alexa himself
0,It was more of a meme I made a detection script for discord notifications
0,Actual ddos protection would be done with bpf
0,let me introduce dload super duper intelligence
0,That's cool alexa is good at that stuff. I just prefer to experiment provide my own setup to cute people like @Lord
0,i was given lifetime canada armoredvm for free
0,I bought mine cause I like to support my friends and not mooch off them
0,You even bought my address from me
0,boutta get a custom api for chatgpt
0,each new attack it auto patches with an AI generated table
0,Man you know how many people doing Windows rn
0,I need to make a win10/11 template
0,il start a sniper only plutonium bo2 server and name it AlexaLand
0,People won't just use Windows server 2022
0,i need one for a pluto server
0,thats really the only use for em anymore
0,so I need to do a template fr
0,I need to just remake all templates.
0,The ones provided by Virtualizor are so old.
0,the packages outdated by 200+ so it takes a while to update.
0,then its also on default .DE update domains.
0,so US is getting packages from EU regions
0,i will be needing one here soon tho fr
0,going to make a genuine official game server for pluto
0,can u help me setup xlink for halo
0,If you don't mind it in ams you can do it on 1 of mine when it's delivered
0,i think you create lobbies via the hud
0,i thought you knew how to host servers
0,if xlink already has a game like halo3
0,you can just host your own lobby
0,everything to do with core services they keep tight
0,yea you would basically have to remake xlink entirely to do that
0,was thinking of making a tool that allows u to perform rte functions via a website
0,alexa trying to protect ry from nelly for once
0,I'm trying to better myself for you as I have failed your vision of Alexa.
0,1 week until my ams server is here
0,alot of old cheats work as well
0,you apparently just need to draw the ui different
0,i seen an NL and onetap tester already
0,apparently anything to do with drawing just needed a slight change
0,cant wait to stomp public dm's and 1v1 servers
0,and get a lot of angry steam comments
0,you're the least deserving of one here
0,i bet if i emailed all of courvix asking for one i'd get hundreds
0,Yeah but they won't even donate $1
0,why would you wana use a cheat made by someone who legit sees you as a $
0,im not the asking type you see
0,That's because last time you asked you got rejected.
0,this is why you keep getting your butt impaled by nelly's prong
0,implying this isnt every single cheat ever because they're businesses
0,@Lexis please type service tor start on my vps i’m not home
0,i.e OG onetap dev overdosed on coke just tryina stay up for days working on anti aim
0,sir you just broke in a week ago
0,not on CA you never changed the pass on the one serv
0,i used one tap when it was invite only + when it went public wasnt that good
0,it was really good you just need to finesse it
0,hvh is for losers so i dont need to do that
0,it went from who was a better player/configger to who plays like a bigger faggot
0,too bad i think unity is gone now
0,legit the last i cared for it
0,@/sbin do you do anything other than make vpns out of the server you have lmao
0,throwback to when it was only boofvpn and Stallionvpn
0,alexa forced me to get the server he wouldn’t stop choking me
0,@rylen you sure you don't want a vm on my ams server when it's out?
0,idk never used it i just knew the owner
0,we were the only 2 vpns out at the time besides octo
0,I'm sorry to inform you that this is false
0,next up we go to a gun range and I steal ur gun
0,alexa told me to hang myself :/
0,not incorrect. ive been doing this dumb shit since NFO was still rather new to the public
0,slammed stallionvpn out of psn parties with stressthem
0,ovh wasnt even a thing yet type beat
0,boof is best if @astrid WOULD FIX THE FUCKING AUTHASDFH
0,Nfo is amazing I just wish they altered the way some of their filters are setup. They are rather sensitive
0,the more you guys to continue to answer wrong the longer ur ban will be - alexa
0,Mother I am outside at the moment I will be back home shortly
0,nfo was so new when i started boof legit all you can do when you got slammed was reinstall centos 6
0,really old old method of fixing a null
0,it was around prior but it wasnt called boof
0,i just had servers with my homie hab
0,so somehow a reinstall is supposed to make an ip start routing on the internet again
0,That is why nobody has been able to hit it? And the only boof related that has ever been touched was my home
0,each time it got flopped i reinstall centos 6 the shit for openvpn
0,@!                    MigueLitros marica
0,False ask cali I have been trying to move boof from that dogshit hosting
0,the string based firewall shit was still a rather new thing
0,i only like it because it works so smoooooove
0,so can ovh if it’s setup correctly
0,0 soon hopefully I want to replace most USA servers with a combination of ovh and nfo and possibly a linode or 2 and royale
0,can you give me one actual reason why unlike other people?
0,path is a bad company do to there owners
0,investor money is spent on coke and hookers
0,one of them obligated his girlfriend to see CP with him
0,I have 8 bans most of which are for fuck all
0,the owners of path are ex felons and there team like to abuse there rights
0,im at 0 and i talk my shit for over a decade
0,alot of my family are felons as well so

0,my dad and brother already been did their time lol
0,my dad got clapped with a gun my brother got clapped with a bunch of pills
0,how’s the rat count down in the sewers today?
0,Seems like the NFO forums were around as early as 2002
0,not only can i make your bill hundred of bucks cheaper
0,yeah. theres some pieces of history on their forum. like when they were talking about a 100mbps ddos attack crippling the entire internap pop they were in back then
0,It will be nonexistent because I'm not partaking I'm the path servers they are smelly and gay and easily replaceable with better servers

0,i use to slam the world during a pk battle
0,I was looking into an nfo dedi but they don't offer 10gb ports and the only form of firewall offered is server side. So I decided against it
0,the ROT clan has an exploit to get players ips that are within render distance of them
0,Although in the future it might be funny
0,As far as I heard they where using iptables for “DDoS” protection 💀
0,because runescape would buy nfo and put their own tables on it
0,I was under this impression too but ry explained that only the firewall on the site uses iptables
0,I actually kinda want something like that
0,nah it was so simple to where the introduction of string based firewall shit blew our minds

0,yea wait til you are of age then we need a girth check for the books
0,can you dm me what locations are going to be added so ik what embeds to correct
0,That was like 6 months ago tho
0,Mane if you ain't girthy like a tree stump I ain't interested
0,Tiny is cute because its adorable and funny and makes dominant people feel better because in comparison their normal size is massive
0,Very false I get called cute by people all the time both online and irl
0,Maybe of @Lexis makes another cute channel that's 18+
0,There's an option for NSFW channels ya know?
0,seconded for another community hotness channel because it makes all of the fascist teenagers in here mad
0,You really think a clumsy kid in a discord cares about a nsfw filter
0,Can't bitch and moan if they had a warning saying it's for 18+
0,Why you think all those porn sites have that warning?
0,"they always click ""Yes let me see"" and then complain"
0,Yeah yeah stop waffling and hurry up and make one idiot
0,Fr I would post nudes in 18+ channel if 1 existed
0,Dead ass I got a cute shower video that I would post
0,Didn’t Alexa have like a leg channel or somthing like that
0,Yeah ok buddy if astrids not written on your ass then it’s fake
0,I do not believe i have all those pics saved.
0,@Lexis let me send in there also
0,@Lexis give post privileges and change to NSFW channel
0,Now we can call the kids retarded
0,Just staring at the channel waiting for that video...
0,I was promised treasure and all I've gotten is lies
0,Well to bad you can’t post in there
0,That’s the hallway at my school when the bell rings
0,typically i don’t bike on cocaine mountains
0,And that's gotta be a record for summoning Blitz
0,I don't care its a w for me
0,Yeah I’ve seen that video online before buddy nice try
0,Not sure what I Was expecting but it wasn't that
0,Why not? I'm a degenerate obviously I take sus shower videos
0,I said this would happen when I turned 18
0,I was expecting like a shower selfie
0,I said a cute video you ape
0,Bro I have a feeling @astrid definitely is going to get all the old creeps on Grindr now Lmaoo
0,I have a lot of the blocked. But I am talking with a few extremely cute people
0,I have one of those 2 but I don’t play Xbox
0,I have one of those but can't redeem it
0,I just have to hold a w on those apes. Someone had to post something super sus and I don't have any self respect
0,I mean I wasn't gonna say it but yeah
0,Your saying that but you can’t even see the whole thing
0,No I have other things for girth
0,So do your parents know that you do that ?
0,Lord barely talked in hunnid up discord but now he gay as hell here
0,Or do you not live with them or somthing
0,She knows I have them I don't think she knows I posted them in a server with com retards though
0,Bout to expose astrid for that fake vid rq
0,Just got a shelf of em on your wall?
0,Go for it's a video of me I can show the toy on its own if you want lmao
0,No they are in a drawer in my cupboard. She used to go searching for shit in my room until she found them and now she doesn't
0,Best way to get parents to stop searching your room
0,It’s Alexa’s server what you expect 💀
0,"That boy blitz lowkey replaced his bike seat with an 8"" schlong with some heavy girth"
0,Yeah it has been ever since you posted flat earth crap
0,Fr I don't care if she finds them. They are very funny and cool and I like them. So it makes no difference to me if she knows I have them. It's my body I will put what I want in it
0,Anyways this shit is disgusting cannot imagine exposing myself on the internet to 80 odd people like that
0,I got 1 that's almost half a metre
0,His chair has a built in dildo and he’s on pc all day no wonder his shits gaped
0,I never would've thought Snav would be the first com tard to get upset with community hotness
0,an 18 year old masturbating? NO? REALLY?! THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS!!!!
0,I was meaning make videos and or having a dildo
0,I thought it'd just be a picture of a dildo
0,THERE WAS NOT MFS FUCKIN THEMSELVES INT HE LAST SERVER
0,I TOLD YOU HEED THE NSFW WARNING
0,i clicked it before you said that
0,Yeah my pics the only acceptable and real images in that channel rn
0,dude you had nsfw ont he old one and it was only thighs
0,I removed NSFW on my thigh pics pal
0,how can you even cum doing that
0,massive local issue. didnt head the nsfw tag
0,I had the channel hidden so idk
0,I remember it being nsfw idk mane
0,dunno. i never have. it only makes regular orgasms feel better so you have to be doing that at the same time
0,Might be thinking of the thigh channels tho
0,Gonna get some pussy later on tonight
0,Wait it's not the fat chick is it?
0,Prostate go brrr and it feels way better that way
0,so you jump on a dildo while jerking off
0,snav flew too close to the sun. poor boy should've listened
0,I wouldn’t say fat she just has big thighs
0,Yeah but purge from dyno let me specify message types
0,Ight so now you're falsifying information is she fat or thick?
0,my face when i opened that bullshit
0,So she’s chunky not fat but got a little bit of weight
0,mute it and right click at the top and hide muted channels
0,Idk what too call it she has a decently slim waist but her thighs are huge
0,huge tits big hips big thighs big ass skinny waist
0,If the waist is slim and the curves are kicking then I'm thinkin bout stickin
0,@Lexis so can I post any NSFW stuff in that channel?
0,Cause I can’t be bothered to buy condoms
0,And idk if I’m tryna raw dog it
0,Can it get much worse than what you already posted?
0,Well that's some of the more tame stuff. So I was wondering if I can add more
0,These people with their weird redundant questions
0,nigga asks if she can post anything like she didn't post as detailed and hardcore a view as possible
0,Naw don’t raw dog it unless she’s good looking like you could see yourself being with her for awil
0,ok we need to redefine this channel name
0,Yeah nah I don’t wanna be with her
0,We made out last time and she started grinding on me we were gonna fuck then but I couldn’t get hard cause of the mdma
0,Maybe have a community hotness channel for more tame stuff like selfies and less NSFW?
0,And my dick kinda sore rn I beat that shit too hard yesterday
0,Since SOMEONE wanted to post a video of them getting DICKED DOWN in the shower
0,Time to overtake the sus channel and normal channel
0,I was going for like 40 minutes cause I was still recovering from that mdma
0,I’ll post in the Warned one in 4 months
0,Bold of you to assume we will be here in 4 months pal.
0,Gonna have to save all these pics locally as a backup
0,Hey is that skeeter in your pfp or I’m i tripping
0,Yeah look in the tame one instead
0,dressing gown rn. warming hands up with coffee rn
0,See I’m cool bc I’m 18 😉
0,I usually warm my hands up by cupping my balls
0,you'll pay for all the homies exception
0,i did my part in the nsfw bs
0,"I clearly have the option to ""Request cash"" turned off"
0,my skirt is haunted by a ghost
0,And this dude still clicking then complaining about what he sees
0,This boy went on his ArmoredVM Canada 5900x and then went into NSFW just to complain
0,yea i try not to show much unless i get paid for it
0,this shit is freaky and fucking weird
0,well if someone has em they can post em
0,It's a video why are you so pressed about it?
0,monkeys and apes touching the hot stove and crying despite the stove being red hot = armoredvm niggas
0,@Lexis Prevent this weird shit from being talked about in general
0,not a tranny riding a cock no i havnt and i don’t ever wanna see that again
0,Is it blocked in general by chat filters? >> no? >> Allowed.
0,Yrx saying all that shit when he saving the video for later
0,it’s a dude riding a cock bro
0,Then why did you look in the chat literally labeled NSFW BE WARNED?
0,Operation Gay Sting has been a tremendous success
0,Hehehehehe maybe later I will post some more stuff
0,@Dictated no balls you won't look in #community-nsfw-be-warned
0,At that point just make an OF
0,Alexa can we have server flex channel ?
0,Ye add a gen chat channel where we can discuss the hotness images
0,i tried paying my invoice a few days after my server expired and now alexa just has my money
0,if you send money AFTER it expires.
0,he wants to be a com kid
0,Who wants to be a “com kid”
0,that shit got boring after i got banned from all over for not going offline
0,make a channel like “ server flex “ or some shit where niggas can flex there specs
0,cause my server is better then urs
0,my entire vpn literally runs off the sparking almost on fire small black box in astrids basement
0,If you stop talking about your amazing server
0,you know dam well you wont ever use it
0,I love how upset I made people by having a good time
0,8 core ryzen 9 5900x 16gb ram from the best hosting provided by @Lexis
0,i got that cpu in my fuckin pc rn
0,your servers weaker than my poor person pc
0,Ryzen 9 5950x 128gb ram 2tb ssd 10gb port 👉👈
0,I find it crazy how many people flipped out as on discord I’ve seen so many fucked up shit so that was mid compared
0,i fr need a 5950x and or a 3dx chip
0,fuckin current cpu legit idle chillin at 4.5ghz all core
0,Mane I'm a software dev. Why am I being tasked with reprogramming our keypad locks lmfao
0,I have a 3090ti in my pc shall i sell my pc as a server also has a 5900x with 32gb of ram and a m.2 and a ssd
0,We’ll come cop my pc gonna make it a vm
0,I got 80gb ram in my PC get fucked
0,im not moving through the everglades to get to you kid
0,i have a jeep and a truck
0,same spec as courvix's vps server for the email
0,i dont even have to pull out the big guns
0,@Lord she gave me a hickey the other day
0,Boohoo you have a discoloured mark on your neck for a few days
0,My wife gives me hickeys all the time I love it
0,havent had one in a couple of years tbh. sad nigga hours
0,ima give you sum if you don’t shut up
0,There's enough of me to go around
0,ok no Way these kids can mess this up
0,Idk if I liked it but I didn’t dislike it ygm
0,can you move ur freak tranny porn to a private role?
0,so we don’t have to mix it up?
0,Literally click on something then cry about clicking on it
0,Not even he can fucking hide it if he wants but you know he’s already saved the video
0,DUDE I WAS IN A CALL AND CAME BACK AND IT WENT TO THAT CHANNEL
0,Dude's tryna save face and convince himself and everyone else that he didn't like it
0,Yes because Discord is gonna auto switch you to a different channel and bypass the NSFW message
0,"LOL on god its like hes trying so hard ""guys i PROMISE i didnt like it. more so than everybody else that i can tell you. everybody knows i hated it. you know it i know it everybody knows it. nobody hated it more than me folks"""
0,dude u was in a call on discord came back to the channel and it went to a highlighted channel and it was that and i immediately blocked
0,@astrid why’s your shower floor styrofoam tho
0,The Hillsboro ovh is sexy no cap
0,buy a mf Canada it’s so hot
0,I live like couple mins away from  it
0,Routing in hills used to be terrible
0,When I had used it it was like 30 without Ethernet then I think 15 with
0,so the routing is much better on hills
0,it used to go from Hills to Canada to Hills
0,I have a feeling not a lot of people buy the Hillsboro one as most people I feel like our on the east side of the states
0,i have a feeling you need to shut the hell up
0,It was my old house it was an old fashion bathroom so it was all tile and plastic bath tub
0,i have a feeling your finna get knocked out ni****
0,Fr I think yrx got a crush on me
0,Anyway just got the pic of me after a facial so that's a w
0,And a few other things from my archive of sus things
0,And this is what you decide to do
0,That's legal in all the legal books
0,i see so many “ blocked messages “
0,Only just going through with it as its legal
0,Yeah but we all know your still reading them
0,Do I happen to be one of those
0,no it was taken after he changed age.
0,No the video is not cp. I had the plan to do this last summer
0,They decided to post some nsfw content last summer when they turn 18
0,He’s a chimp what do you expect
0,In old server I wanted to post but I wasn't 18 so I couldn't
0,Now I'm 18 I can post what I want in the NSFW channel
0,Why would I assume that he meant that he planned that out
0,@astrid did u move out of ur parents house?
0,No as a collective we just bought a new house without mortgage as its better in terms of funds that way. And jts split 3 ways between me and my siblings
0,you can do all this in PFSense
0,I will be buying their parts when they are 18 so it can be my house
0,Too bad that doesnt run on dedicated firewall hardware
0,I dont think you’re understanding what is meant by “dedicated firewall hardware”
0,since you call PFSense a software NON DEDICATED HARDWARE
0,PFsense is literally a Dedicated BSD Install.
0,Its a custom linux based OS for the firewalla
0,Was but I need to reapply next school year
0,and PFSense is a custom BSD Based for PFSense.
0,This is the definition of “nerd gathering”
0,"You keep saying firewalla is a ""Dedicated firewall device"""
0,you can do everything on PFSense for free that Firewalla does.
0,Well yes firewalla is software that runs on the firewalla dedicated firewall hardware
0,It's literally the same thing as pfsense being on a raspberry pi
0,Yes and PFSense is a Software stack that runs on any number of Dedicated Firewall hardware.
0,It's literally no diff than PFSense in the way that it runs
0,You can literally do it on a PI
0,It LITERALLY says the same stack runs on the raspberry pi
0,That doesnt mean it is the same thing though
0,The ONLY difference between ANYTHING is that Firewalla is meant for end-user noobness with their GUI.
0,sure it can run on a raspi
0,It LITERALLY says it's the same thing
0,Xewdy it is literally no different dude
0,Time to bring out my 2 dozen pi cluster
0,I’ll be even more jacked by then anyway
0,that Firewalla device does NOT have enterprise capability for packet filtering
0,Where you are and what you are interested in doing
0,$230 and it doesn't even support gigabit speeds
0,xewdy believes every youtube video he sees
0,the only one I actually like is the Gold Plus
0,Near London tryna dig into them guts
0,you believe earth is flat shut up
0,i'd rather buy a Cheap server for PFSense
0,$500 I could get a managed switch and some raspberry pis and setup my own shit
0,Make a pi cluster with a managed switch and do the same thing for 80% less
0,Xewdy is in such denial over this $230 device
0,*The Purple SE uses high-quality hardware components such as a quad-core processor dual-band Wi-Fi and gigabit Ethernet ports which contribute to its performance and reliability. These components can be more expensive than those found in lower-end routers.*
0,I'm in Wellingborough so if you want then sure
0,Oh no not something a Xeon of IVY Bridge era can smack around
0,Raspberry pi 4 has quad core CPU dual band wifi gigabit ethernet
0,Like I said use a pi with a managed switch save 80% of your money and have the same or better results
0,idk what xewdy is trying to emphasize here.
0,always wanted to dabble with a pi but never knew what i'd actually do with it and since im not a com kid that buys servers and then asks the host what to do with them i just havent bothered
0,I bought a couple pis a while back
0,With the lil deauth scripts on them
0,Now I just use my pi to host a plex server and some network storage
0,"though i was thinking to get an ADSB receiver and have it feed data to the pi and have my own little localized ""radar"" :SCCUTE:"
0,Before that I haven't touched them in years
0,what do you want drifted you bush head
0,"a PFsense deployed on a Dedicated Machine is a ""Dedicated device"""
0,You dont even read you just respond
0,Just because the PCB is different means absolutely nothing
0,tell me how this firewalla is so much better
0,You listed specs the pi4 has the same specs
0,just because I read faster than you doesn't mean I didnt read sir.
0,And make excuses for every little thing
0,I've told you that you can do everything on a PFsense box.
0,That little firewalla device is NOTHING DIFFERENT other than the GUI.
0,The only difference is they packaged it in a little plastic case and added a fancy UI
0,Xewdy beefing the almighty Alexa once again
0,Literally just a overhyped Noob centric GUI
0,With the same hardware you can do on anything
0,Yeah he’s Retarded only I know alexas weak spot
0,"So then why are you touting their ""Dedicated device"""
0,Well the experience is part of it
0,you can literally get an INTEL NUC and do the same thing
0,So you agree that you're paying a like $150 markup for the sole purpose of an easy to use GUI?
0,The firewalla has specific hardware components meant for its task
0,It has the same hardware a raspberry pi has
0,it has the same ARM/Intel CPU as anything else
0,Which is different than just using a raspi or a $50 pc
0,the Firewalla Gold Plus has a INTEL 4 CORE CPU
0,What components does it have that are different?
0,smells so good in this subway station
0,We all know your overwhelmed with the smell of piss rn
0,Dude sent it and got warned already and he sent it again
0,I didnt send the same thing tard
0,"""Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.8GHz"""
0,this kid xewdy things its something special what the fuck
0,"""high quality ethernet"" probably some broadcom chipset"
0,This is the same thing a pi has
0,"""dedicated hardware components"" ok get us a teardown"
0,It's the same components from a raspberry pi on a slightly modified PCB
0,It's nothing special it's just all wrapped up in a pretty little plastic case with a nice GUI on it with a huge markup in price
0,There is NO Hardware specifically for DPI.
0,And that is fine for people that don't understand how to setup anything themselves but it's not the only option and it's nothing special
0,You showed nothing you sent a description. Hell I showed more hardware specs for the firewalla than you did
0,literally xewdy getting drawn into marketing for noobs right now
0,*In fact many network security and traffic management devices including the Firewalla device use dedicated hardware components such as network processors ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) or FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) to accelerate DPI and other network tasks. These hardware components are specifically designed to handle large volumes of network traffic and perform complex packet analysis and filtering tasks.*
0,STOP WITH THE NERD TALK GO BACK TO TALKING ABOU #community-nsfw-be-warned
0,There's no Fucking ASICs on that board
0,they're literally just explaining that other devices use hardware components.
0,in contrast to the firewalla which does not.
0,*The Firewalla device utilizes a custom-designed PCB (Printed Circuit Board) that includes several dedicated hardware components including ASICs network processors and other specialized components. These components are optimized for network security and traffic management tasks and are specifically chosen to provide the best possible performance and efficiency for the device.*
0,it has no ASICs meant for DPI
0,I swear to fucking God if a com retard doesn't make fun of me for the new pics in that channel I'm going to cry
0,Well correct but it does have them
0,You can find the specs on the site i was just listing the specific relevant hardware components
0,That little device would do much less processing of ANYTHING as compared to say an intel i5 11400 on PFSense.
0,And the specs on the site are identical or sub par compared to a raspberry pi 4
0,These things are literally based from NanoPi
0,```Firewalla is a purely software-based system all processing is done via CPU cores. By using the CPU firewalla can examine packets with much more flexibility and go deeper than just the simple IP header. ```
0,@Lexis can we get monke back and with correct perms this time? 😭
0,```Firewalla is a purely software-based system all processing is done via CPU cores. By using the CPU firewalla can examine packets with much more flexibility and go deeper than just the simple IP header. ```
0,Xewedy that one kid in school that don’t clean their ears
0,Something he can't seem to wrap his head around :kek:
0,i just remembered i was in that hoe like
0,The CPU is literally doing all the processing
0,Sorry Xewdy me and lord are more sensible and look at facts.
0,I'm not saying it's a bad product it's great for people that have no real knowledge
0,PFSense and OPNSense on your grandma's old Dell Optiplex on Ebay is so much better
0,But it's literally just free software with a pretty GUI wrapped up and sold at a markup
0,Sure with specific hardware meant to improve performance of the operations firewalla is doing
0,"It's ""special"" in their comparison to a normal router"
0,Because a standard router has a piss poor CPU
0,even normal routers if you go high enough have very good CPUs
0,Which is literally what they say in their FAQ
0,```While most consumer and business routers are optimized for speed.  They rely on specialized hardware to forward packets.  This specialized hardware is fast but does not have the flexibility to move around the packet header.   They have less CPU power and less memory is required. ```
0,but at 200 dollars? I can easily get a quad core router
0,Which would cost around the price of the firewalla purple SE
0,I bought my RT-3100 Asus on Ebay for $100
0,False because you don't need a fancy router to do those things if you setup pfsense on a pi or something
0,You can use your standard router + a pi and a switch for about $50
0,"and to make a ""router"" you just need an old PC."
0,old PC Stick a wifi card in there less than $100 easy all day
0,or just re-utilize old router with it
0,old router as Access point for PFsense.
0,now you only spent $50 on a pc on ebay
0,or if you got old PC laying around
0,Me and astrid gonna release some content in #community-nsfw-be-warned later this year
0,https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-ax1800/ this is a cool router. I have 1 running as a relay
0,The thing is i do realize you can replicate most of the features with something like a raspi I purchased it because it has a really cool interface and is easy to use
0,But you're literally acting like it's so much better sir.
0,and i can do everything from my phone
0,Quad core and supports 99% of the shit you are arguing about
0,you can do everything from a phone on PFsense and OPNSense too
0,I mean it is better is some ways
0,OPNSense being more user friendly than PFsense.
0,and the fact i can manage completely from my phone
0,"the only ""better"" is you can stick it in your pocket but i countered that with you can use an INTEL NUC or Mini PC that can fit in your pocket anyway"
0,Shitty little nuc and it's better than firewalla
0,anyway its sitting at a stable 600ms
0,The fuck is up with that to be 600ms
0,i did latency command 4 times 5 sec apart
0,Yes and the fact that it has all of those features bundled together in one
0,For a raspi youd have to install several apps to come close to the same amount of features
0,thats fine im on about the role i had to verify users for ipscan commands n shit
0,That's to discord api but it shouldn't be that high
0,"Lord he's swapping topic from the ""hardware"" that was disproven3000 times to now the GUI again"
0,you accidently gave that role the perms monke bot itself needed
0,Like I said it's not a bad product it's just for people that don't know how to set it up themselves
0,There's no special dedicated hardware it's just a fancy GUI packed in with free software and marked up
0,dont need a verify role or full perms
0,Which I mean like a lot of products are fancy designs on free shit resold
0,So it's not horrible it's just. Like I said nothing special
0,imagine spending $300 for a useless router add on
0,@Lord should get my bot in your server so you can remotely talk trash to niggas thru it
0,Virgin media decided to upgrade my speed +60mbs noice
0,Yes but im not purchasing it for the fact that i cant set something up like it on a raspi for example i bought it because it seemed like a really cool product
0,Must be nice I pay for gig speeds and barely get 100mbps
0,if you think its sketch as in getting your discord clapped thru it can get you source access
0,just wana get my bot out there somehow
0,Damn I pay £25 a month for this shit
0,"And that's where I disagree because you're paying for a ""really cool product"" when there are free alternatives"
0,Either you have the knowledge to setup the free alternatives yourself or you don't and you pay for the easy one
0,My virgin media is maxed at 160 even tho I pay for 200
0,if you have the fastest speed in your area they usually give you the free upgrade when they increase it
0,essentially a plan based system where only the speeds change in each one
0,Wouldnt be free for me because id still have to purchase another device to run the software on
0,Right but it'd be a lot cheaper
0,And i don’t necessarily “need” it so this isnt really my intention
0,You can buy an old PC and a switch for under $100
0,Nah I pay for 200mbs but it goes up to a gig in my area
0,And that $230 one doesn't even support gig speeds
0,they may have bumped all the plans
0,oh shit i stumbled into the hood
0,Fortunately for me I dont have gigabit speeds anyways
0,A bottleneck in your router would kill your LAN speeds too
0,Hm it’s ok most times I pay for 250 or 200 I don’t remember but get 160 ish most time even with router settings chsnged
0,@Replays what hood is this crips or blood?
0,Really I pay nothing over 30 quid
0,I complain alot to them so they lowered it
0,Yeah I can’t remember the exact price
0,When you want to leave it’s always ‘no no I’ll speak to my boss and see if we have any deals’
0,Yeah every broadband company  does that lol
0,@./Cali low-key not tryna smash her tonight cause I’m only gonna be smokin bud so imma just say I can’t cause it’s Ramadan

0,Idk about that 1. There are 2 people currently aged under 25 asking to sleep with me. 1 of them even wants to take me out to dinner and then go back to a hotel and rail me until I forget my own name
0,You’re fat who would fuck a fat person
0,@astrid lemme rail u with a strap on
0,Why would I do that. Only liking 1 gender is boring. I think liking anyone I develop a friendship/relationship with is way better. Gender is irrelevant
0,I dont understand how gays feel attracted to males. Can someone explain the feeling? How is hairy dude that stinks comparable to slim girl with nice smile?
0,Being a boy and getting fucked by a cock just sounds wrong
0,Do you know how to open the menu on gta5 on ps5 but on the ps4 version
0,Like where I can call in my jet
0,Wouldn’t you rather be stickin it in a girls tight pussy instead lol
0,Exactly so that's why I'm a girl getting fucked instead
0,what do dudes see in other dudes that makes it attractive
0,You’re a fat retard with mental illness
0,whats the thing that attracts guys to guys
0,Easy it's all down to preferences. Some guy like big boobs others like ass. Some like both. Other like little boobs. It's all down to preferences. Not every gay guy will like men with lots of hair. And most gay guys smell good
0,when I think of female its obviously the pussy and the leg lock that excites me
0,is she happy with u or is she fucking some other guys
0,Happy cuddles during the netflix and chill
0,I’ve been with her for 2 years Buddy
0,ye but I mean whats the exciting part
0,Im the one who took her v funny thing
0,when it comes to females its the entire being
0,I like tall guys that that are strong but not overly muscular. I also like them to have a personality
0,so its a submissive feeling for you?
0,Likes tall guys that are strong while being a fat piece of shit
0,Dicks are cool but it's more about the person with the dick. Well for me anyway
0,High standards when you’re a fat loser
0,Some people are just hoes and will sleep with anyone
0,So you wait explain this to me ur a male and get pleasure over another male sticking his dick in u @astrid ?
0,so its like life companion with benefits and good time while the body/gender is less of an issue
0,Not a male but yes being railed feels good. There is a thing called the prostate and it's really sensitive when stimulated so being railed feels good
0,an the erotic side is entire body
0,My girl loves being railed by me yo
0,Well if she's happy then that's good
0,I'm currently drinking alcohol and thinking about stuff
0,Looks like you are missing a few numbers try adding an extra 0
0,doubting there's a she to begin with
0,I mean your phone is kinda right
0,I don’t get it you come into chat and just chat random shit to me acting like I care? Is it jealousy that I’m getting some pussy or what @keratin
0,:catsip: yes i actively come into this server to talk shit there's no jealousy when i aint got a clue who the fuck you are
0,I can see now how guys can find other guys attractive and girls can do same with other girls. Thanks for explaining @astrid I were genuinely interested about the thinking behind as I would cringe if I had to cuddle with a dude but seeing its basically less than 10% of what makes it attractive to begin with and more of overall feeling than physical stuff I can now imagine why it is like that. Too little people bother to think from other perspective.
0,Me too I like to do it while I shit
0,do sum bout it you red role
0,If u ain’t done a girl that’s on her period then like I feel bad for u
0,you ain't done a girl in the first place son
0,I have and I ain’t ya son
0,Yep hence why most guys that hookup for a 1 time thing don't really cuddle. The bottom gets pleasure and so does the top then they go back to their thing. If the 2 people are more than fuck buddies then they will cuddles and and enjoy each others company and closeness
0,I guess I almost had similar experience @astrid  I had a friend as 12yo that I could not had been enough of. I was best friends with him and I was almost obsessed about him
0,:catsip: go get some bitches before u make outrageous claims

0,Oh yeah like I’m going to show u my acc details
0,oh nah mf friends with a sheman :cryin2:
0,It's more awkward with guys like that as you don't want to push for more as it might ruin what you have but at the same time pushing forwards might make something even better happen
0,did i ask for your account details?
0,Get a bitch on ur tip and talk to me
0,Idk i have a load of people blocked with a plugin to hide whatever they say
0,im just trying to understand how people feel but I cant quite imagine  yet @concretedrinker

0,you're the one dodging to show ya money :catsip: sounds like a brokie move
0,cuz it was the strongest feeling I remember towards another guy
0,@astrid im under a 500gb attack does nothing
0,I don’t talk to people who are jealous of having a girl
0,why the hell is there a comma in there
0,:catsip: exactly why you're talking to me now quit dodging and show funds
0,we making it out of the slums!!!
0,clearly you're alright with the idea :cryin5:
0,I wont make fun of sexual minorities anymore
0,I don't have any experience with girls in terms of trying to be with 1 in a NSFW way. All the cute girls I know like Claire and cali and cici live super far away and all the ones around where I live are all retarded at the moment and I don't really have much of an interest in them. A few have had interest in me but I could never develop a closeness to them.
0,@concretedrinker wow not even 300 this week 😦
0,@Stefe what did you say to me
0,I will happily get with someone if I develop an attachment to them. But the girls my age are all idiots that lie and have secrets and just over all annoying in my area. So I haven't really got an interest. However if I could steal the cuties I know from online then I would have a nice collection. And then with the cute guys I would also steal it would be a great time
0,have you sold actual pictures of your feet?
0,i need to sell pics of my feet
0,Those are great pics I do rate them a 10/10

1,worldcom ex-boss launches defence lawyers defending former worldcom chief bernie ebbers against a battery of fraud charges have called a company whistleblower as their first witness.  cynthia cooper  worldcom s ex-head of internal accounting  alerted directors to irregular accounting practices at the us telecoms giant in 2002. her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn (£5.7bn) accounting fraud. mr ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.  prosecution lawyers have argued that mr ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at worldcom  ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet wall street earnings estimates. but ms cooper  who now runs her own consulting business  told a jury in new york on wednesday that external auditors arthur andersen had approved worldcom s accounting in early 2001 and 2002. she said andersen had given a  green light  to the procedures and practices used by worldcom. mr ebber s lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud  arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.  ms cooper also said that during shareholder meetings mr ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company s finance chief  giving only  brief  answers himself. the prosecution s star witness  former worldcom financial chief scott sullivan  has said that mr ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm  telling him to  hit our books . however  ms cooper said mr sullivan had not mentioned  anything uncomfortable  about worldcom s accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. mr ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004  and is now known as mci. last week  mci agreed to a buyout by verizon communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.
0,german business confidence slides german business confidence fell in february knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in europe s largest economy.  munich-based research institute ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in february from 97.5 in january  its first decline in three months. the study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.   we re surprised that the ifo index has taken such a knock   said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner.  the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak  particularly in the retail trade.  economy and labour minister wolfgang clement called the dip in february s ifo confidence figure  a very mild decline . he said that despite the retreat  the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected  a modest economic upswing  to continue.  germany s economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. however  the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004  mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and ifo president hans-werner sinn said any improvement in german domestic demand was sluggish. exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004  but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making german products less competitive overseas. on top of that  the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms  including daimlerchrysler  siemens and volkswagen  have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. analysts said that the ifo figures and germany s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the european central bank. eurozone interest rates are at 2%  but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation  prompting fears that interest rates may rise.
